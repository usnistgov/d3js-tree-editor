# d3js Tree Editor

This is a basic tree editor written in Javascript and [d3js](http://d3js.org/).

The editor has a context menu for renaming, deleting and creating nodes. Right-click on a node to get the context menu for rename, delete and create.

There are also buttons for saving the tree, downloading it, uploading a saved version, and sort the nodes (alphabetical for now, frequency to come next).

Dragging can be performed on any node other than root (flare).
Dropping can be done on any node.

Panning can either be done by dragging an empty part of the SVG around or dragging a node towards an edge.

Zooming is performed by either double clicking on an empty part of the SVG or by scrolling the mouse-wheel.
To Zoom out hold shift when double-clicking.

Expanding and collapsing of nodes is achieved by clicking on the desired node.

The tree auto-calculates its sizes both horizontally and vertically so it can adapt between many nodes being present in the view to very few whilst making the view managable and pleasing on the eye.

The tree must be served by the flask webserver in the flask/ subdirectory.
